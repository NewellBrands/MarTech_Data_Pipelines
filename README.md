# Listrak Pipelines

This is the code repository for Listrak API related libraries and pipelines.

## ListrakWriter Library

The *listrakwriter.py* library was designed to pull data for triggered and promotional emails and contacts through the Listrak API. It's currently being used in the Listrak Pipelines for the **List Health, Deliverability and Conversation Reports**. It relies on a support script called *utils* which has API credentials and unique brand identifiers used in the platform, among other data.
