# ListrakWriter

The ListrakWriter library was designed to pull data for triggered and promotional emails and contacts through the Listrak API. It's currently being used in the Listrak Pipelines for the List Health, Deliverability and Conversation Reports. It relies on a support script called utils which has API credentials and unique brand identifiers used in the platform, among other data.
